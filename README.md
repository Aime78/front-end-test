This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, built with the latest tech stacks such as TypeScript, React query, tailwind css. You can check a [`live demo here`](https://front-end-test-2fjq9zkpi-aime78.vercel.app/).

## The strategy for rebuilding the legacy application

- First, I would make sure to gather all necessary information about the legacy application and its current functionality, as well as gather requirements from the business team, design team, backend engineers, and other stakeholders. This would involve conducting meetings and workshops with the relevant parties to ensure that we have a clear understanding of the goals and needs for the new application.

- Next, I would work with the team to create a project plan and timeline that outlines the various stages of development and key milestones. This would involve breaking the project down into smaller, manageable chunks of work, and assigning tasks to team members based on their expertise and availability.

- Once the project plan is in place, I would start by setting up the development environment and necessary tools, such as a version control system (e.g. Git) and a project management tool (e.g. JIRA). I would also establish clear communication channels and processes for the team to follow throughout the project.

- After the initial setup is complete, I would begin working on the front-end application using the specified technologies (e.g. Nextjs). This would involve building out the necessary UI/UX components and integrating them with the back-end API to retrieve and display data from the legacy application.

- As we progress through the development process, it would be important to ensure that we are adhering to best practices for code structure, readability, and maintainability. This would involve writing clean, well-documented code, as well as regularly conducting code reviews to identify potential issues and improve the overall quality of the application.

- In order to ensure a great user experience for users with low internet speeds, we would need to optimize the application for performance. This would involve techniques such as lazy loading, optimizing images and other assets, and minimizing the number of HTTP requests made by the application.

- As we near the end of the development process, we would conduct thorough testing to ensure that the application is bug-free and ready for deployment. This would involve both manual testing by team members and automated testing using tools such as Jest and Continous integration (CI) tool like Jenkins.

- Once all necessary testing has been completed and any necessary fixes have been made, we would deploy the new front-end application to the production environment and make it available to users.

- Finally, we would monitor the application after deployment to identify and fix any issues that may arise. This can include using error tracking tools such as Sentry or Rollbar to identify and fix production issues in real-time. We would also regularly release updates and new features to keep the application up-to-date and address any identified issues.
